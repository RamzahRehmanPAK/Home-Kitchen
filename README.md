# Home-Kitchen
HomeKitchen, bridges the gap between the demand and supply of homemade
food in big metropolitan cities like Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad, where a lot of people move in
for education or work. Their only source of food is expensive hotels or substandard dhabas,
and are in a constant search of homemade food. On the other hand, there are many women who want to earn money with their cooking skills without leaving the vicinity of their homes. HomeKitchen, a web based application, proved a platform where sellers can advertise their food items and buys can order fresh homemade food.
